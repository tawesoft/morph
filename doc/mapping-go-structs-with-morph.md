# Apples to Oranges: mapping between Go structs with Morph

Take the source code for an example struct, Apple, which uses custom-made
weight and price packages.

```go
type Apple struct {
    Picked    time.Time
    LastEaten time.Time
    Weight    weight.Weight
    Price     price.Price
}
```

Let's say we want a new struct, similar to this, but where every field is an
integer, to make it easier to serialise and interoperate with other systems.

We're going to call it an Orange.

> **Note:** for clarity, going forward we'll be precise and call `type T 
> struct` a struct type definition, `T` a struct type, `var t T` a struct 
> value definition, and `t` a struct value.


## Parsing a struct type definition from source code

First, we need to tell morph about the struct type definition.

Using [morph.ParseStruct] we can extract this from a string literal or
from a Go source file:

```go
apple, err := morph.ParseStruct("apple.go", nil, "Apple")
```

> **Example code:** [morph.ParseStruct (from string) example]

> **Example code:** [morph.ParseStruct (from file) example]

Morph doesn't need to fully resolve identifiers like the `weight.Weight` and 
`price.Price` types of the Weight and Price fields, so we don't need to tell 
morph anything about them or parse any additional definitions.

For our own understanding, let's assume these packages look something
like this:

```go
package weight

type Weight struct { /* ... */ }
func (w Weight) Grams() int64 { /* ... */ }
func FromGrams(grams int64) Weight { /* ... */ }
```

```go
package price

type Price struct { /* ... */ }
func (p Price) Pence() int64 { /* ... */ }
func FromPence(pennies int64) Price { /* ... */ }
```

Again, these definitions are just for us, and don't need to be written down
anywhere.

> **Tip:** Morph doesn't need full type information. The Go compiler, not
> Morph, is the right place to verify our generated code for type-correctness.

## Mapping to a new struct type definition

There are two ways Morph can change our parsed Apple struct type definition 
into our desired Orange struct type definition. We can also combine the two.

* Using a [morph.StructMapper] and the [morph.Struct.Map] method.
* Using a [morph.FieldMapper] and the [morph.Struct.MapFields] method.

A FieldMapper is easier to write, but a StructMapper is more powerful.

### Using a StructMapper to rename a struct type

A StructMapper is a function that takes a copy of a struct as input, and 
outputs a new struct.

The [structmappers package] contains useful things for working with
StructMappers, like the [structmappers.Rename] function that returns a 
new StructMapper that sets a struct's name to the provided argument.

```go
orange := apple.Map(structmappers.Rename("Orange"))
```

> **Example code:** [structmappers.Rename example]

> **Tip:** You might think that it's simpler just to set the Name field on the
> `morph.Struct` directly, but we should always prefer to use an appropriate 
> mapper. The reason why will become clear soon.

We've taken the first step in morphing our Apple. By printing the resulting
mapped struct, we can generate some source code for a new
struct type definition:

```go
fmt.Println(orange)
```

So far, this prints the following string:

```go
type Orange struct {
    Picked    time.Time
    LastEaten time.Time
    Weight    weight.Weight
    Price     price.Price
}
```

Next, we need to work on converting the fields to integers.

[structmappers.Rename example]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tawesoft/morph/structmappers#example-Rename


### Using a FieldMapper to change a struct type

A FieldMapper is a function that is called on every field on an input struct
in turn, and generates output fields on an output struct.

For our Apple, that means a FieldMapper will be called once each for the fields
`Picked`, `LastEaten`, `Weight`, and `Price`.

The [fieldmappers package] contains useful things for working with 
FieldMappers, like the FieldMapper implementation [fieldmappers.TimeToInt64]
which suits our purposes.

This, as its name suggests, maps `time.Time` fields to `int64` values. Other
fields are left unchanged, and output normally.

FieldMappers are applied through the [morph.Struct.MapFields] method.

```go
orange = orange.MapFields(fieldmappers.TimeToInt64)
```

> **Example code:** [fieldmappers.TimeToInt64 example]

FieldMappers are often general purpose enough that they can be reused and 
combined in different situations.

So far we've mapped the first two fields of our struct type definition.
Printing the result generates the following string of source code:

```go
type Orange struct {
    Picked    int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    LastEaten int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    Weight    weight.Weight
    Price     price.Price
}
```

If you'll notice, `fieldmappers.TimeToInt64` automatically set a nice comment 
for us too.

We still want to map our `Weight` and `Price` fields, so it's time to make
our own FieldMappers.

[fieldmappers.TimeToInt64 example]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tawesoft/morph/fieldmappers#example-TimeToInt64


### Creating a custom FieldMapper

A FieldMapper has the following signature:

```go
type morph.FieldMapper func(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field))
```

The `input` argument lets us discriminate what fields we want our mapper to 
apply to. The `emit` function controls what fields are generated on the output.
If we don't emit the field, that field is removed. If we emit more than once,
we can emit multiple fields per input field.

The simplest FieldMapper is one that does nothing but emit the input
unchanged:

```go
func Passthrough(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field)) {
    emit(input)
}
```

Let's implement our FieldMapper for weight and price separately, and let's
discriminate on field type, rather than name, so that it's more
general-purpose and reusable.

```go
func WeightToInt64(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field)) {
    if input.Type == "weight.Weight" {
        output := input // copy
        output.Type = "int64" // rewrite the type
        emit(output)
    } else {
        emit(input)
    }
}
```

> **Tip:** it is always safe to copy or modify the input argument inside a 
> StructMapper or a FieldMpper.

> **Practice:** what would a FieldMapper for the Price field look like?

We'll add more to this later, but it's enough for generating a struct
type definition for our Orange.

> **Example** [morph.FieldMapper example]

Now, by composing multiple StructMappers and FieldMappers we get our Orange:

```go
orange := apple.Map(
    structmappers.Rename("orange"),
).MapFields(
    fieldmappers.TimeToInt64,
    WeightToInt64,
    PriceToInt64, //  left as exercise for reader
)
fmt.Println(ornage)
```

This generates:

```go
type Orange struct {
    Picked    int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    LastEaten int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    Weight    int64
    Price     int64
}
```

> changes, then the struct type definition for Orange will also update 
> appropriately.

[morph.FieldMapper example]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tawesoft/morph#example-FieldMapper


### Composing mappers

A FieldMapper can be promoted to a StructMapper:

```go
fm := morph.FieldMapper(fieldmappers.TimeToInt64)
sm := fm.StructMapper()
```

Multiple FieldMapper values can be composed to a single FieldMapper value:

```go
fms := fieldmappers.Compose(
    fieldMappers.TimeToInt64,
    WeightToInt64,
    PriceToInt64,
)
```

And multiple StructMapper values can be composed to a single StructMapper
value:

```go
sms := structmappers.Compose(
    structmappers.Rename("Foo"),
    fieldmappers.TimeToInt64.StructMapper(),
)
```


## Defining operations on struct values

> **Tip:** 
> You don't have to have used Morph to generate a struct type definition to get
> value out of this section. You can still define operations on struct values
> of existing struct types.

We've now got a full definition for our new Orange struct type, automatically
derived from our starting Apple type.

```go
type Orange struct {
    Picked    int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    LastEaten int64 // time in seconds since Unix epoch
    Weight    int64
    Price     int64
}
```

But what about when we have a value of type Apple or a value of type Orange?

Let's say we have an Apple value in our source code:

```go
apple := Apple{
    Picked: time.Parse(time.DateTime, "2023-05-29 09:00:00"")
    // LastEaten: zero value
    Weight: weight.FromString("50 kg")
    Price: price.FromString("Â£1.23")
}
```

We may want to be able to convert to an orange, and back, like so:

```go
orange := apple.ToOrange()
appleAgain := orange.ToApple()
```

> **Tip:** if you don't like these as methods, Morph can just as easily 
> generate functions in the form `AppleToOrange(input Apple) Orange`
> or `AppleToOrange(dest *Orange, input apple).`

To do this, we need to define a FieldExpression for each field on
the generated morph.Struct representation, in this case, a "converter" 
expression.

This is done through the same FieldMapper applications that we've seen before.

For example, the FieldMapper implemented at `fieldmappers.TimeToInt64` has 
already provided a converter expression automatically to fields of type
`time.Time`.

With this expression set, we can use Morph to generate a function based on
the set converter expressions.

In this case, this is the [morph.Struct.Converter] method. In cases where
we've defined new operations, we would instead use
[morph.Struct.CustomUnaryFunction] and [morph.Struct.CustomBinaryFunction].

We also need to supply a function signature for our generated function.
The function signature is quite flexible in how it can be written, but in 
this case it must have a source value of the source type (here, Apple), and 
exactly one destination value of the result type (here, Orange).

```go
const converterSignature = "(apple Apple) ToOrange() Orange"
```

We can alternatively use $-tokens to fill in some of the function 
signature for us with variables:

```go
const converterSignature = "($src.$type.$untitle $src.$type) To$dest.$type() $dest.$type"
```

This might look a little ugly, but we only have to write it once. In the
future, we can reuse this template function signature on different struct types 
without having to write a new function signature manually.

> **Tip:** We'll learn more about the $-token syntax later.

Now we can let morph generate a converter function for us:

```go
appleToOrange, err := orange.Converter(converterSignature)
fmt.Println(appleToOrange)
```

This generates an output like so:

```go
// ToOrange converts [Apple] to [Orange].
func (apple Apple) ToOrange() Orange {
    return = Orange{
        Picked:    apple.Picked.UTC().Unix(),
        LastEaten: apple.LastEaten.UTC().Unix(),
        Weight:    apple.Weight,
        Price:     apple.Price,
    }
}
```

> **Tip:**  the output might not look exactly like this, but the generated
> code will give the same result.

Note that the Weight and Price fields are just being copied without any 
conversion happening. This is because when we created a FieldMapper for 
weights and prices, we didn't define a converter FieldExpression.

Let's go back to our custom FieldMapper implementation, and add a new
Converter FieldExpression on the emitted Weight field:

```go
func WeightToInt64(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field)) {
    if input.Type == "weight.Weight" {
        output: = input
        output.Type = "int64"
        
        // how to convert from weight.Weight to int64
        output.Converter = "$dest.$ = $src.$.Grams()"
        
        emit(output)
    } else {
        emit(input)
    }
}
```

Again, the Price mapping has been left as an exercise.

Here we see $-tokens again. The full syntax is described by
[morph.FieldExpression], but here's a few examples:

| Token        | Description                                           | Example                                                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$src.$`     | Input struct name and current field name              | `$src.$` replaced with `apple.Weight`.                                           |
| `$dest.$`    | Output struct name and current field name             | `$dest.$` replaced with `orange.Weight`.                                         |
| `*.$type`    | Type of the current token.                            | `$dest.$type` replaced with `Orange`.                                            |
| `*.$name`    | Name of the current token, removing pointers.         | `$dest.$type.$name`, where `$dest.$type` is `*Orange`, replaced with `Orange`.   |
| `*.$untitle` | Name of the current token, first character lowercase. | `$dest.$type.$untitle`, where `$dest.$type` is `Orange`, replaced with `orange`. |

With our FieldMapper updated, this is enough to generate the forward mapping, 
a function that converts a value of type `Apple` to a value of type `Orange`. 

> **Example:** [morph.Struct.Converter example]

```go
func (apple Apple) ToOrange() Orange {
    return Orange{
        Picked:    apple.Picked.UTC().Unix(),
        LastEaten: apple.LastEaten.UTC().Unix(),
        Weight:    apple.Weight.Grams(),
        Price:     apple.Price.Pence()
    }
}
```

But what about the reverse, `ToApple`?

### Generating a reverse struct value conversion function

This is where some magic happens.

We want to generate a function, `func (orange Orange) ToApple() Apple`,
that maps Orange struct values back into Apple struct values.

We could do this by reversing our steps, and applying StructMappers and 
FieldMappers in reverse order, that perform the opposite mappings, to undo the 
changes we've made.

That would be a bit awkward, however, because all the fields on our Orange
are now of type `int64` and it's difficult to discriminate between them.

Fortunately, many StructMappers and FieldMappers are reversible, so we can
have morph do this for us!

```go
appleFromOrange := orange.Map(structmappers.Reverse) // magic!!!
```

> **Tip:** the const `converterSignature` template string from the 
> previous section came in handy! Thanks to the token replacement, we didn't 
> have to specify a function signature again.

But before we do this, let's go back to our custom FieldMapper 
implementations for Weight and Price one last time, and add the finishing 
touches to make them reversible too.

A reverse function is simple to write. It is just a FieldMapper, but as it is 
only called on a field that has explicitly set it as its reverse function, 
it does not need to discriminate on name or type. The original mapper then 
registers the Reverse function on the emitted field.

So, we need to update our FieldMapper to set the Reverse function. For good
measure, we can set the Comment, too.

When we set the Reverse function on a field, we compose it with the field's 
existing reverse function. This means that even if we've applied several 
transformations to a field, we can still reverse them all in order.

> **Tip:** if a mapping is not reversible, set the Reverse function to nil.

This makes our full custom mapper for the weight field look as follows:

```go
func WeightToInt64(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field)) {
    reverse := func(input morph.Field, emit func(output morph.Field)) {
        output := input
        output.Type = "weight.Weight"
        output.Converter = "$dest.$ = weight.FromGrams($src.$)"
        output.Comment = ""
        emit(output)
    }

    if input.Type == "weight.Weight" {
        output := input
        output.Type = "int64"
        output.Converter = "$dest.$ = $src.$.Grams()"
        output.Reverse = fieldmappers.Compose(reverse, output.Reverse)
        output.Comment = "weight in grams"
        emit(output)
    } else {
        emit(input)
    }
}
```

So finally:

```go
appleFromOrange := orange.Map(structmappers.Reverse)
orangeToApple, err := StructConverter(converterSignature, orange, apple)
fmt.Println(orangeToApple)
```

This outputs generated source code for a function that converts
struct values of type Orange back to struct values of type Apple:

```go
// ToApple converts [Orange] to [Apple].
func (orange Orange) ToApple() Apple {
    return Apple{
        Picked:    time.Unix(orange.Picked, 0).UTC(),
        LastEaten: time.Unix(orange.LastEaten, 0).UTC(),
        Weight:    weight.FromGrams(orange.Weight),
        Price:     price.FromPence(orange.Price),
    }
}
```
